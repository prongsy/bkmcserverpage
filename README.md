# BK Minecraft Server Info

A server information page I made for my friend's Minecraft server. Shows the server's message of the day, gives options for connecting, shows online status, server version, server logo, online player count, online player list, and a server map with pins of built areas and player locations.

Uses React and Bootstrap.

Uses a Minecraft API to update information every 5 minutes. You can find this API at https://api.mcsrvstat.us/

Has an embedded server map from DynMap.

This was a personal project to get up to speed using React, Bootstrap, and APIs.
